# Project Title: 
Real-time Price Aggregation and Normalization for US Structured Finance Securities

# Project Objective:
To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of pricing US structured finance securities by automating the process of collecting, cleaning, and normalizing market price data from multiple sources.

# Technical Approach:

**Data Ingestion:**
Developed Python scripts to extract real-time price data from various sources, including Bloomberg, Reuters, FINRA, Intex, FNMA, and GNMA, using their respective APIs and web scraping techniques.
Implemented robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure data reliability.

**Data Cleaning and Normalization:**
Utilized SQL queries to clean and transform the extracted data, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Implemented normalization techniques to standardize pricing conventions and methodologies across different sources.

**Data Storage and Processing:**
Stored the cleaned and normalized data in a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
Developed Python scripts to process the data, calculate key metrics like price spreads, implied volatilities, and other relevant indicators.

**Real-time Dashboard:**
Built an interactive dashboard using a visualization library like Plotly or Dash to display real-time price information, key metrics, and trends.
Implemented features to filter and customize the dashboard based on user preferences.
