# Real-time Price Aggregation and Normalization for US Structured Finance Securities (2014)

**Description:**

Developed a data-driven solution to automate the real-time aggregation and normalization of market price data for US structured finance securities. This project streamlined the pricing process by collecting, cleaning, and standardizing data from diverse sources, including Bloomberg, Reuters, FINRA, Intex, FNMA, and GNMA. By implementing robust data pipelines and real-time dashboards, this project significantly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of pricing operations, empowering the pricing analyst team with timely and data-driven insights.

**Key Technologies (Circa 2014):**

* Programming Languages: Python (2.7), SQL
* Data Engineering: Data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and loading (ETL)
* Data Analysis and Visualization: Data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization techniques (Matplotlib, basic web-based dashboards)
* Data Storage: SQL Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* API Integration: Bloomberg API (older versions), Reuters API, FINRA API, Intex API, FNMA API, GNMA API
* Web Scraping: Beautiful Soup, Scrapy
* Scripting/Automation: Cron jobs, custom scripts

**Project Overview:**

* **Data Ingestion:**
    * Developed Python 2.7 scripts to extract real-time price data from multiple sources using their respective APIs and web scraping techniques.
    * Implemented robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure data reliability and minimize data loss.
    * Used cron jobs or custom scripts for scheduled data ingestion tasks.
* **Data Cleaning and Normalization:**
    * Employed SQL queries to clean and transform the extracted data, addressing missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
    * Implemented data normalization techniques to standardize pricing conventions and methodologies across various data sources, ensuring data consistency.
* **Data Storage and Processing:**
    * Stored the cleaned and normalized data in a SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL) for efficient querying and analysis.
    * Developed Python scripts to process the data, calculating key metrics such as price spreads, implied volatilities, and other relevant indicators.
* **Real-time Dashboard:**
    * Built basic web-based dashboards using technologies like Matplotlib for visualizations, and simple web frameworks, to display real-time price information, key metrics, and trends.
    * Implemented basic filtering and customization features to cater to user preferences and enhance data exploration.
